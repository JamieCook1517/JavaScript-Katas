# JavaScript-Katas

A repository with a file of katas performing various algorithms using JavaScript, involving test-driven development (TDD).

## Installation 

1. Copy the link of this repository, go to a working directory on your terminal and type in **git clone _repository link_** to the terminal. The folder will then be installed onto the directory.
2. Type **cd JavaScript-Katas** on the terminal.
3. Type **npm init -y** on the terminal to install the JSON package. This way you will be initialising the test-driven development.
4. Type **npm install --save--dev jest** on the terminal.
5. Go into the package.json file and on line 7 replace that in inverted commas with the word jest. This will enable the TDD with Jest.  

## Usage

Type **npm test** or **npm t** on the terminal in the \_\_tests\_\_ directory. This will run the tests, marking them successful. The functions do a different thing each such as returning a sum of multiples of 3 and 5 below a given number, returning a pounds total from a given object of different coin types and returning information about a tweet. The javascript_katas_test.js file documents further information.
